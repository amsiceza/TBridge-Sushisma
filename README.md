## Styles üñç
Sass is a CSS preprocessor that allows developers to write styles in a more efficient and modular way. With Sass, you can use variables, functions, loops, and other advanced features that are not available in native CSS. This makes the process of writing and maintaining styles much easier and more efficient.

By styling all the styles in Sass without using any framework, you can push the limits of what is possible with Sass and native CSS. This can be a challenging task as it involves writing all the style rules from scratch instead of using pre-defined classes and styles provided by frameworks.

However, by doing it this way, you can have greater control over the styles and ensure they are exactly what you want, rather than being limited by the options provided in a framework. Additionally, it can result in lighter and faster code as you're not loading any additional framework.

## Views and options üì∫

We have also paid special attention to navigation and usability in each view of our website. We have created intuitive menus that allow visitors to easily navigate between different sections of our website, and we have ensured that the views are responsive and adapt to different devices and screen sizes.

Overall, our website is designed to provide an exceptional user experience and enable visitors to find the information they need effortlessly. We hope you enjoy exploring the different views of our website and feel inspired by the design and functionality we have created.
